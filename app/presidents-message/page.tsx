          Center for Indian Cultural Education, Bal Vihar of St. Louis, a nonprofit, 501(c ) 3
          organization was founded 32 years ago to instill and foster East Indian Cultural in the
          children of ages 5 through 18. Bal Vihar has been providing this service to the St. Louis
          community since August 1992 and has been growing in number of students ever since then.
          Sincere thanks to all professional volunteers who invest their valuable time in preserving

          Normally, this independent organization has been active in diversity program where Bal
          Vihar youth children had been active in projects at St. Louis Science Center, St. Louis
          arts Museum, Magic House and more projects where children of different faiths such as
          Christians, Muslims, Jews and other faiths work together in projects such as can-structure
          through the St. Louis based Interfaith organization. Our children also carry out
          activities in Churches, Mosques and Synagogue to appreciate diversity and learn other
          faiths. But, due to pandemic environment, coronavirus, the activities were held virtual.
          Starting last school year, we are holding limited sessions in person and also our
          community activities such as Diwali, Holi, Canstruction, Food for Needy and more in the
          St. Louis area.

          Our students are taught discipline, diversity, respect and devotion in their daily
          routine. The ultimate goal is "to throw the light of cultural knowledge on every child, to
          make every child an outstanding citizen and to spread the song of peace and harmony around
          the world."
